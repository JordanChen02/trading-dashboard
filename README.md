# 🧭 Edgeboard

**Edgeboard** is a personal trading analytics dashboard built with **Streamlit + Python**, designed to analyze performance, track journaling habits, and visualize trading data through a clean, modular interface.  
It’s my main data companion for evaluating setups, refining edge quality, and staying objective in live markets.

---

## 🌐 Overview

Edgeboard consolidates all aspects of trade tracking into one visual workspace:
- Performance analytics
- Equity & drawdown tracking
- Journal review
- Calendar-based summaries
- Setup checklists and grading

Everything updates dynamically through CSV imports or live journaling, with all pages connected through a shared state system.

## 💡 Design Philosophy

Edgeboard was built to feel like a native trading app:
- Fast, minimal, and data-driven  
- Every metric and chart is contextual — not decorative  
- Focused on **clarity over complexity**  
- Modular enough to expand into a full trade-tracking ecosystem later
